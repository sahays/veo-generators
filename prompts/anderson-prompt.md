Style & Tone: Wes Anderson aesthetic. Whimsical, upbeat, romantic. High saturation, pastel color palette (pinks,
yellows, cyans). Flat lighting, planimetric composition (shooting straight on), perfect symmetry. Format: Vertical Split
Screen (50/50) for Scene 1; Full Screen for Scene 2.

Characters (Stylized):

Steve: White male, late 20s. Wearing a mustard-yellow corduroy blazer, a blue oxford shirt, and vintage horn-rimmed
glasses. Quirky but handsome. Anna: White female, late 20s. Wearing a pastel pink trench coat, a red beret, and holding
a vintage leather purse. Bright and doe-eyed. Scene 1 (4 Seconds): The Synchronized Swipe

Visuals: Left Side (Steve): Steve sits stiffly on a mid-century modern velvet sofa. The wall behind him is patterned
wallpaper (teal). A window shows a stylized, flat Seattle Space Needle in the distance. Right Side (Anna): Anna sits on
a bus stop bench (bright yellow). The background is a flat view of downtown Seattle storefronts (pastel colors). Action:
Both hold their phones with both hands. In perfect synchronization, they swipe right. A distinct "ding" sound (implied).
They both look up at the camera and smile quirkily at the exact same time. Scene 2 (4 Seconds): The Twee Meeting

Transition: A "Whip Pan" (fast blur) transition that mimics a camera swishing to the right, landing instantly on the new
scene. Location: An Italian Trattoria. Red and white checkered tablecloths. A candle in a Chianti bottle. Symmetrical
framing. Action: Correction: We remove the walking entry because it takes too long. New Action: Steve and Anna are
already seated in a booth, facing each other in perfect profile (side view). They are frozen like a painting for a split
second. Then, simultaneously, they raise a breadstick like a toast and take a bite. The mood is charming and
awkward-romantic.
