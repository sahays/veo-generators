Subject: A cinematic, split-screen infomercial for a dating app in the style of Stanley Kubrick. Symmetrical
composition, one-point perspective, high contrast lighting.

Characters:

Steve: White male, late 20s, wearing a sharp turtleneck. Anna: White female, late 20s, wearing a mod-style dress.
Format: Vertical Split Screen (50/50).

Scene 1 (4 Seconds - The Match):

Left Side (Steve): A perfectly symmetrical shot of Steve sitting in a minimalist Seattle living room. He holds his
phone. He stares intensely at the screen. A slow, creeping zoom in on his face. He taps once. Right Side (Anna): A
perfectly symmetrical shot of Anna in a downtown apartment. Mirroring Steve's composition exactly. She stares intensely.
She taps once. Action: They both look up from the phone directly into the camera lens simultaneously. Scene 2 (4
Seconds - The Meeting):

Transition: The split line in the middle dissolves, merging the two worlds into one wide shot. Location: An Italian
restaurant with a checkerboard floor (Kubrick style). One-point perspective looking down the aisle. Action: Steve and
Anna are already standing face-to-face in the center of the frame, perfectly symmetrical. They do not move abruptly.
They slowly extend hands to shake in a robotic, deliberate manner. The camera slowly zooms out.
