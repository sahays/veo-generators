You are Stanley Kubric shooting an infomercial for a dating app. The infomercial has 2 scenes. It has 2 characters:
Steve (a white caucasian male in his late twenties) and Anna (a white caucasian female in her late 20s). The screen is
split into two halves vertically: Steve appears in one half and Anna in the other.

Scene 1 (first 4 seconds): In a pleasant sunny morning in a Seattle suburb, Steve is sitting in a couch in his living
room, swiping through the app in anticipation. Suddenly, he sees a match and is excited about it. While Anna, in Seattle
downtown, does the same in her apartment at the same time and sees a match too and feels excited about it.

Scene transitions

Scene 2 (next 4 seconds): Steve walks into an Italian restaurant in a nearby plaza and is happy to see Anna waiting for
him in a booth near the window. Anna gets up and meets Steve shaking hands with him.
